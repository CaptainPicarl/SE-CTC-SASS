Picarl's CTC SASS Script

Note: If you are building from scratch yourself: You need to add a mixin project containing the Weaponcore PB API. 

Currently located here (As of 29MAR2025):
https://github.com/Ash-LikeSnow/WeaponCore/blob/master/Data/Scripts/CoreSystems/Api/CoreSystemsPbApi.cs

There is a reference in this solution / project that will break if you do not. 

That said: There should be no issue with copy/pasting the script provided from the latest Release. The WCAPI is compiled in there for you ahead of time.
